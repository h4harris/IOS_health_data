# IOS Native Health Data
Analyze & get benefit from iPhone health data for daily life style and better health

## Purpose
The actual purpose of this repo is to fulfil an academic task. 
Below are that high level tasks being done here, i.e:

Parsing apple native health data, performing data processing, analysis, gaps, feature engineering, forecasting and finally improving health statistics and life style {data wrangling}

## Problem

1.  The biggest problem is the academic FP, that I have to complete in next 3 days ‚Ä¶
    Ha ha ‚Ä¶  kidding ‚Ä¶
    
2.  There is a list of problems but the problem with highest severity was that I was getting notifications from watch since last year and then warnings from health app that my Vo2max value critically low, it went down to 35 and for my age (41) it should remain >40 as a minimum (lowest) threshold. Went to cardiologist and he took some tests and said that I don‚Äôt remember this value Vo2max as I studied during specialization but don‚Äôt remember now. So when I enrolled in this academic session I did some EDA on my health data (end of May-2024) and found several trends / routines that I was repeating over and over (daily), so I applied several walk / running profiles based on mistakes (identified by EDA process) and in July Vo2Max was 44.7

3.  List goes on ‚Ä¶  predicting my vitals for next quarter based on my last year‚Äôs data

10.  Here we are interested in 'export.xml' and gps tracklogs i.e: 'workout-routes' folder

11.  Upload this folder to google drive or set local machine's directory as path in python code

13.  For any directory path issues while playing py,  below is the reference directory tree

##Author Thoughts:

Since the topic of academic task was open so i had many options in the field of ML/AI/DataScience. All i ever wanted is to work on image classification, face tagging and GAN's. Image processing tasks were practiced well on a GPU PC, like face tagging via training a basic and CNN and further a YOLO on a large custom data set as i have over 65,000/- facial images in my Google Photos app and nearly 100 are already tagged. So it performed well on a GPU based machine but sadly its taken back and i dont have access to it. Secondly i loved to work on GAN's as back in 2022 someone shared me a VQGAN+CLIP notebook and it was working and played with it but it was black box for me as at that time i was unaware of python and ML. Then in march 2022 i played with MIDJOURNEY V2 via custom deployed notebook and finally tried discord in August-22 on MIDJOURNEY V3.
Due to limitation of GPU (on colab entire RAM is eaten up) i finally ended up in writing a XML parser, analyzing data, doing preprocessing feature engineering and predictions. The basic parser i wrote back in May-24 during EDA sessions, that saved a lot of time for now and i continued it today. This reminds me old back year 2005 when i wrote a NMEA parser for my yellow eTrex as a sub-part of my BE FYP. Finally after 2 decades i ended up again in a more or less similar task,  but the ML part is new here :)
Also my academic session was ending on July-31 and i was in an impression that i would be free onwards and made already commitments so i had only 2-3 days for this (minus workplace hours)  

I remember old days (2005) when i played with eTrex on serial db9 interface for BE FYP, Android was very weak that time and Symbian S60v3 was near its end of life. The google API, PHP...
It took me 3 months in old days to interface native Google earth with MySQL and HTTP server to show live location of eTrex and my S60v3 mobile.
Since then, no coding just basic scripting for SQA.
Python and its plugins {components, libraries} made life extremely easy.
In 2022 at my workplace we built a system for foreign client and it utilizes Elastic Search via Kibana, AL models can also be utilized here. The next step that will make this small project very useful is its integration with elasticsearch / Kibana. 

I realized that data analysis is difficult, especially when we do not have in depth understanding of data and its (domain or work products),  so before opening IDE do read documentation and understand the problem without any doubts otherwise, we end up in verification and validation dilemma.
